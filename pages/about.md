Hi there,

My name is Marina, I'm a software developer focusing on development for Apple platforms, living in Copenhagen.
I've been in tech for almost 15 years. Working with Apple platforms since 2011, leading teams and building apps & SDKs.

I'm a Unix geek turned Apple nerd 🤓 Topics I care about include privacy, equal opportunity, and climate change 💚

Nowadays I work as an engineering manager at [Lun](https://lun.energy), helping decarbonize homes faster.

Besides occasionally [consulting startups and individuals](/mentorship/), 
you can find me curating <a href="https://ioscodereview.com"> iOS Code Review newsletter</a> and co-organizing
[Copenhagen Cocoa](https://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenCocoa/) meetups.

My my past 9-to-5 adventures include leading the iOS team at [Storytel](https://storytel.com) for 4 years, supporting
company's growth from a small startup to a 500-person company.
I've also built B2B products at [Citrix/GetGo](https://get.gotoassist.com), led consumer app development at [PrimeApp](https://vk.com/primeapp) and built apps for over a dozen of companies at Russia's largest agency [iD East](https://id-east.ru). 
I've also maintained and ran the iOS efforts of open-source [Say Their Names project ✊🏽](https://saytheirnames.io).
My CV and references can be found on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hybridcattt).

I've recently been interviewed on [AppForce1 podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1414396/10721946) - check it out if you're curious about my journey.
