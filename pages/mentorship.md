I've been working in the tech industry for almost 15 years, growing from an apprentice
to a seasoned developer who has held lead positions in multiple companies. I've trained and mentored dozens of developers. Let's see how I can help you? 

## 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 For startups 

Often early stage founders can’t afford to hire senior engineers in-house. 
There's also an ongoing shortage of senior developers on the market.

Why not get an experienced mentor instead?

What I can do for you:
- mentor your promising juniors on ongoing basis (so they level up faster)
- help you pick the most suitable technical stack and direction
- review your development and operations processes and suggest optimizations
- write code / setup DevOps / etc - whenever your team needs an extra hand
- much more, depending on the stage of your company

You'll sleep tight knowing that your tech is in safe hands.

[Send me a quick email](mailto:hello@hybridcattt.com?subject=Marina,%20let's%20collaborate!) if you'd like me to help you take your company to the next level 🚀 

## 🌏 Career coaching package

You can book a career coaching package with me. 
I will review your profile and code from the point of view of a hiring company. 

You'll get actionable advice on what to improve in your profile and code to make it more attractive to employers.
I will also give you tips on going through interviews and on searching for jobs abroad. 

What's included: 
- feedback on your resume (CV) and LinkedIn
- technical feedback on your test assignments that you did during interview process with other companies (up to 3)
- feedback on your Github profile and online presence
- 1,5h live session where you can ask any questions including tips on interview process or finding a job abroad.

## 👩‍💻 Free mentorship program

A few years ago I decided to actively give back to the community by mentoring iOS developers.

I have 2-3 mentees at any given time. It's a number where I can offer reasonable level of support. 
Private mentorship is completely free, no strings attached. 
I'm more likely to take you on if you are from a group that's underrepresented in tech.
Diversity means not only gender or race, but also education and even country of origin.

I'm not taking new mentees at the moment, but don't hesitate to reach out
and I will try to refer you to another mentor.
