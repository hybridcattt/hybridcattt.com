With over 15 years in the tech industry as a developer and a leader, I've trained and mentored dozens of developers. Let's see how I can help you?

## üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ For startups 

Often early stage founders can‚Äôt afford to hire senior engineers in-house. 
There's also an ongoing shortage of senior developers on the market.

Why not get an experienced mentor instead?

What I can do for you:
- mentor your promising juniors on ongoing basis (so they level up faster)
- help you pick the most suitable technical stack and direction
- review your development and operations processes and suggest optimizations
- write code / setup DevOps / etc - whenever your team needs an extra hand
- much more, depending on the stage of your company

You'll sleep tight knowing that your tech is in safe hands.

[Send me a quick email](mailto:hello@hybridcattt.com?subject=Marina,%20let's%20collaborate!) if you'd like me to help you take your team to the next level.

## üåè Career coaching package

You can book a career coaching package with me. 
I will review your profile and code from the POV of a hiring company. 

You'll get actionable advice on what to improve in your profile and code to make it more attractive to employers.
I will also give you tips on going through interviews and on searching for jobs abroad. 

What's included: 
- feedback on your resume (CV) and LinkedIn
- technical feedback on your test assignments that you did during interview process with other companies (up to 3)
- feedback on your Github profile and online presence
- 1,5h live session where you can ask any questions including tips on interview process or finding a job abroad.

To book or find out more about the different options, check out my [career coaching page](/private-career-coaching).

## üë©‚Äçüíª Free mentorship program

I have 2-3 mentees in the program at any given time - it's a number where I can offer reasonable level of support. 
Private mentorship is completely free, no strings attached. 

I don't have free slots for new mentees at the moment, though you can still book the career coaching packages above.
